# Autonomous Car Navigation &amp; Control through Computer Vision and Sensor Fusion

# Description
The project design consists of three main blocks. The Computer Vision Module analyzes the car surroundings through a camera to detect traffic signs, traffic lights, vehicles, and human beings, then make decisions accordingly. The Navigation Module consists of a navigation unit and an obstacle detection unit. The navigation unit is responsible for collecting data from sensors to get the current state of the car, like GPS coordination, orientation, and speed. The obstacle detection unit assures that the vehicle avoids hitting obstacles encountered along its path. The Power and Driving Module is responsible for powering the electronics, alongside powering and controlling the acceleration and steering motors.
